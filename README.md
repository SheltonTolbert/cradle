# TODO
 - [ ] fix noise height by moving to biome specific function
 - [ ] add terrain texturing at biome level
 - [ ] implement 'soft edges' for blending between biomes

# Ideas 

## Biomes

- [] A futuristic city biome where the player is hunted by a few mercenaries and the population is non-hostile. Should be puzzle focused with intense bursts of combat
- [] A safari biome with exotic creatures where all npc's are non-hostile.

## Creatures

- [] A massive dosile creature with a handler that is in charge of keeping the creature. If the player defeats the handler, the creature becomes increadlibly aggressive and extremely difficult to defeat.
